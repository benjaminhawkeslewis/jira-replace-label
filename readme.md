# JIRA Replace Label

Small script to replace/rename labels in JIRA.

Bulk replaces in the UI can only replace the entire contents of the labels field, obliterating other labels. This small script uses the excellent python-jira library to replace individual label names within the field, preserving other labels.

You will need to install python-jira 0.13 or better.
